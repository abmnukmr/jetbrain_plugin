                        "text": "Okay, I will create a new controller named `RoutingController` within your `api-gateway` project.  Here's how I'll structure the response:\n\n**1. Explanation of Changes**\n\nI'll create a new Java class file `RoutingController.java` within the `com.abmnu.api_gateway` package.  This class will be annotated as a `@RestController` to handle incoming web requests. For now, I'll provide a basic example with a single endpoint.\n\n**2. Proposed Code for `RoutingController.java`**\n\n```java\npackage com.abmnu.api_gateway;\n\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\n@RestController\npublic class RoutingController {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/route\")\n    public String routeRequest() {\n        return \"Request routed by API Gateway!\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**3. Instructions**\n\n1.  **Create the File:** Create a new file named `RoutingController.java` in the following directory:\n\n    `/Users/abhimanyu.kumar/Documents/microservices/api-gateway/src/main/java/com/abmnu/api_gateway/`\n\n2.  **Paste the Code:** Copy and paste the code from the \"Proposed Code\" section into the `RoutingController.java` file.\n\n3.  **Build the Project:**  Use Maven to rebuild your project. From the `api-gateway` directory in your terminal, run:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./mvnw clean install\n    ```\n\n    This will compile the new controller and package your application.\n\n4.  **Run the Application:** If your application is not already running, start it.\n\n5.  **Test the Endpoint:** After the application is running, you should be able to access the new endpoint using a web browser or a tool like `curl`.  Assuming your API Gateway is running on the default port (8080), you can try the following URL:\n\n    ```\n    http://localhost:8080/route\n    ```\n\n    You should see the response \"Request routed by API Gateway!\".\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Spring Boot Application:**  This code assumes you have a properly configured Spring Boot application in your `api-gateway` project. The `@RestController` annotation and dependency injection are core Spring Boot features.\n*   **Dependencies:** Ensure your `pom.xml` file includes the necessary Spring Web dependencies to use `@RestController` and `@GetMapping`.  Typically, this will be `spring-boot-starter-web`.\n*   **Routing Logic:** The `routeRequest()` method in the example is very basic. You'll need to implement the actual routing logic according to your application's requirements. This might involve using `RestTemplate`, `WebClient`, or Spring Cloud Gateway to forward requests to other microservices.\n*   **Error Handling:** Remember to add proper error handling to your controller methods.\n*   **Configuration:** You might need to configure routing rules in your `application.yml` or `application.properties` file, depending on the complexity of your routing needs.\n*   **Existing Code:** This is an additive change, so it will not affect any of the other files in your project.\n"
